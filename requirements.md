# FastPanel Requirements Document

## 1. Problem Statement

Deploying and managing applications with Docker is powerful but often complex for developers and teams. Common pain points include:

- **Manual CLI Operations:** Most Docker management requires command-line expertise.
- **Lack of Unified UI:** No simple, modern, open-source panel for managing containers, images, and deployments.
- **Slow Onboarding:** New team members or less technical users struggle to deploy or monitor applications.
- **Fragmented Tools:** Existing solutions are either too complex, not open-source, or lack extensibility.

---

## 2. Solution Overview

**FastPanel** is a modern, open-source web panel that simplifies Docker-based application deployment and management. It provides:

- **Unified Web UI:** Manage containers, images, volumes, and networks visually.
- **One-Click Deployments:** Launch applications from templates or custom Dockerfiles/Compose files.
- **Live Logs & Stats:** View real-time logs and resource usage.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Built with Next.js for easy customization and plugin support.
- **Self-Hosted:** Runs on your own infrastructure, with direct access to the Docker Engine.

## 3. Step-by-Step Plan to Build FastPanel

### Step 1: Project Initialization
- Scaffold a Next.js project (for unified frontend and backend).
- Set up TypeScript (optional, but recommended for maintainability).
- Add dependencies: `dockerode`, `better-sqlite3` or `lmdb`, etc.

### Step 2: Docker Integration
- Create API routes in Next.js (`/pages/api/`) to interact with Docker via `dockerode`.
- Implement endpoints for:
  - Listing containers
  - Starting/stopping/restarting/removing containers
  - Listing/pulling/removing images
  - Viewing logs

### Step 3: Basic Web UI
- Build a dashboard page to display containers and their statuses.
- Add controls for starting/stopping/removing containers.
- Display container logs in real-time (using websockets or polling).

### Step 4: Application Deployment
- Add UI and backend logic for deploying new applications:
  - From Docker Compose files
  - From Dockerfiles
  - From pre-defined templates (Node.js, Python, etc.)

### Step 5: Image Management
- UI and API for pulling, building, and removing images.
- Show image details and usage.

### Step 6: Volume & Network Management
- List, create, and remove Docker volumes and networks.

### Step 7: Authentication (Optional)
- Add user authentication (e.g., NextAuth.js) for multi-user environments.

### Step 8: Packaging & Deployment
- Create a Dockerfile for FastPanel itself.
- Document installation and usage.
- (Optional) Add plugin system for extensibility.

### Step 9: Documentation & Testing
- Write user and developer documentation.
- Add tests for API routes and UI components.

## 4. Deliverables

- **Source Code:** Next.js project with all features above.
- **Documentation:** Setup, usage, and contribution guides.
- **Docker Image:** For easy self-hosted deployment.
